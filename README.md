# TDD-GOLang

Welcome to TDD-GOLang! This repository for my learning Golang through Test Driven Design (TDD) principles.

## About

It is based on the wonderful content available at [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/). It provides a structured approach to learning Go by writing tests before writing the actual code. This not only helps in understanding Go syntax and features but also inculcates good software development practices.
